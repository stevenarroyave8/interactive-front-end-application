# interactive-front-end-application
## About 
The purpose of this was to create a collaborative project application that solves a real-world problem. Eveything was created from scratch, no starter code user story or acceptance criteria was provided like in previous weeks.
### Installations
Once downloaded users can click on the index.html page to open the webpage.

Once on the webpage there will be two sets of drop down lists where you will select ingredients of your choice.

One for cocktail ingredients another for the dish ingridients.

Once the respective ingredients are selected you wil hit the submit button that will then prompt your result of a cocktail and a dish to pair it with.
